Wir haben daher selbst viel Kraft und Geld investieren müssen um eine etablierte ERP-Lösung überhaupt bei uns einführen zu können, aus diesem Leidensdruck heraus, haben wir selbst damit begonnen eine ERP-Lösung zu entwickeln welche es uns ermöglicht die von uns hergestellten Individuallösungen in einem ERP/PPS-System abzubilden. Basis dieser Eigenentwicklung ist ERP-Next. Unser so erworbenes Know-How bieten wir nun auch Dritten an. Ein Team von drei Programmierern, einem Interfacedesigner und einem Betriebswirt kümmert sich rein um Beratung, Aufbau, Einführung und Betreuung Ihrer individuellen ERP-Lösung für nachfrageorientiere Produktion.
