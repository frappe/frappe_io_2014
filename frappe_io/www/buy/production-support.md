#### Minimum Server Requirements

Note: Server refers to a root server or managed server or virtual server. Hosting typically refers to only website hosting. ERPNext requires a server, not hosting.

- A stable linux distribution, we recommend CentOS 6, Ubuntu 12+, Debian 7
- Root access via Secured Shell (SSH) connection.
- Server should have a static IP.
- If you choose a commercial linux distribution like RedHat, you will have to buy relevant subscription to installation repositories.
- Port 80 and 8080 should not be blocked by a firewall (by operating system and router).
