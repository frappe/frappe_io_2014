# Creating Roles

Before creating Models, we must create Roles so that we can set permissions on the Model. There are two Roles we will create:

1. Librarian
1. Library Member

To create a new Role, go to:

> File > New... > Role

![New Role](/assets/frappe_io/images/guide/03-new-role.png)

Enter the new Role and Save it:

![Role Saved](/assets/frappe_io/images/guide/04-new-role-saved.png)

{next}
