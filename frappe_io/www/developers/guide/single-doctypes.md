# Single DocTypes

A application will usually have a Settings page. In our application, we can define a page where we can set the loan period. We also need to save this property. In Frappe, this can be done using a **Single** type DocType. A Single DocType is like the Singleton pattern in Java. It is an object with only one instance. Let us call this as **Library Managment Settings**.

To create an new Single DocType, mark the **Is Single** property as checked.
