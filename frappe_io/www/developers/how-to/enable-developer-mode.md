# Enable Developer Mode

When you are in application design mode and you want the changes in your DocTypes, Reports etc to affect the app repository, you must be in **Developer Mode**.

To enable developer mode, update the `site_config.json` file of your site in the sites folder for example:

	frappe-bench/sites/site1/site_config.json

Add this to the JSON object

	"developer_mode": 1
