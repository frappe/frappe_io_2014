# Before You Start

<p class="lead">A list of tools, technologies that will be very helpful for building apps in Frappe.</p>

There are a number of good tutorials online and we found [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) to be the most beautiful ones out there here bunch of lessons you can learn from CodeAcademy

#### 1. Python

Server side Frappe is written in Python and its a good idea to [quickly learn Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) before you started digging into Frappe. Another good place to learn Python is the [tutorial on docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html). Note that Frappe uses Python 2.7

To write quality server side code, you must include automatic tests. You can learn the [basics of test driven development here](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginning-test-driven-development-in-python--net-30137).

#### 2. Databases MariaDB / MySQL

You need to understand the basics of databases, like how to install, login, create new databases, and basic SQL queries. Here is a [very quick introduction to MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-basic-mysql-tutorial) or head to [the MariaDB site for a more detailed understanding](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/documentation/getting-started/)
