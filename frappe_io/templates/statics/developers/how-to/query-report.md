# Query Report

You can create tabulated reports using complex SQL queries by creating a new Report. These reports can be created by a System Manager and are stored in the Database

> Note: You will need System Manager Permissions for this.

To create a new Query Report:

### 1. Create a new Report

![Query Report](/assets/frappe_io/images/how-to/query-report.png)

1. Set type as "Query Report"
1. Set the reference DocType - Users that have access to the reference DocType will have access to the report
1. Set the module - The report will appear in the "Custom Reports" section of the module.
1. Add your Query

### 2. Set the Query and Filters

You can define complex queries such as:


	SELECT
	  `tabProduction Order`.name as "Production Order:Link/Production Order:200",
	  `tabProduction Order`.creation as "Date:Date:120",
	  `tabProduction Order`.production_item as "Item:Link/Item:150",
	  `tabProduction Order`.qty as "To Produce:Int:100",
	  `tabProduction Order`.produced_qty as "Produced:Int:100"
	FROM
	  `tabProduction Order`
	WHERE
	  `tabProduction Order`.docstatus=1
	  AND ifnull(`tabProduction Order`.produced_qty,0) < `tabProduction Order`.qty
	  AND EXISTS (SELECT name from `tabStock Entry` where production_order =`tabProduction Order`.name)

1. To format the columns, set labels for each column in the format: [Label]:[Field Type]/[Options]:[Width]

### 3. Check the Report
