		<h4 class="media-heading">Rushabh Mehta</h4>
		Rushabh is the founder and the chief architect of the ERPNext product. An entrepreneur by fate, it totally bugs him when people ask him, "How's business?". Some years ago, he went to graduate school at the Penn State University to study Industrial Engineering, which he thinks is a big fraud (at least a a part of it). He likes to believe that he is an independent thinker but most people think he is an iconoclast (though his wife thinks that he blindly believes whatever is written at nytimes.com).

		<h4 class="media-heading">Nabin Hait</h4>
		Nabin has been with Web Notes right from the start and keeps the ERPNext product together and brings a lot of stability to the team. Nabin is the first person from his village in West Midnapore to graduate (congrats!) and digs math and puzzles. With not many opportunities in Kolkata, fate brought him to Mumbai and to software. A proud Bengali, the easiest way to bug him is to ask him about Bengali politics. A nature photographer, Nabin's dream is to setup a software unit in Kolkata, so that its a drive away from home, but if you really ask him, a bungalow at Pune's Koregaon Park would be a good idea.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Anand Doshi</h4>
		Anand is a born and bred Mumbaikar with an engineering degree, with passion for software and loads of enthusiasm. Fresh from college, he was picked up by the Great Indian Software Factory called Infosys, where he loved his work, but developers did not have access to internet at work. He now wonders how they worked without Stack Overflow. Family reasons forced him to come back to Mumbai and as fate would have it, he just happened to drop in his resume at Web Notes. He used to be an avid collector of to-do apps, until he discovered the diary. A coffee lover, the easiest way to bug Anand is to ask him why he does not drink tea.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Pratik Vyas</h4>
		Pratik is a rare species in India, someone who is truly passionate about technology. Pratik grew up in Baroda and was lucky to run into Jigish Gohil, a Linux hacker and openSUSE package maintainer who introduced him to the Open Source world. Soon he was reading more man pages than engineering text books. In 2011, he was looking for an internship in an Open Source company and ran into Web Notes. In one month, he managed to upgrade us from SVN to git and GitHub (the original erpnext repository on GitHub was created by him). After graduating, Pratik joined a Pune startup, but kept following the progress at Web Notes. Finally since September of 2013, Pratik is back at Web Notes. Pratik loves *nix, and runs Arch Linux on his shiny MacBook Pro. The easiest way to annoy Pratik is to show off a faster machine (probably with an SSD drive) or ask him to install MacOS on his Mac.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Umair Sayyed</h4>
		Umair handles all customer support at Web Notes and has his helmet and protective gear ready whenever there is a new release round the corner. Umair has also been with Web Notes right from the start and has been involved in almost all implementations. He knows so much about business processes that we think he is going become a business guru very soon. Umair's dream is to start his own business some day and has already attempted to start a restaurant. Umair's big regret is that no one from the development team cares about the tickets he raises, so these days whenever he wants to send a message, he pings a customer and asks them to raise a ticket.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Prakash Hodage</h4>
		Prakash handles all billing, taxation, accounting and statutory requirements to keep the company running. For those who don't know about doing business in India, the government works under the deep suspicion that the primary goal of all business is to cheat their employees and customers, and its job is to shield all these poor people from the evil capitalists. Thankfully Prakash helps us ensuring that follow all the rules and also manages billing and sometimes support. Prakash's dream is to buy his own apartment in the heart of Mumbai City at Dadar, that would cost a fortune today. Prakash loves order and gets really bugged when he sees all the chaos in the office.
