# Why Frappe?

You have probably heard of ERPNext, it is fast gaining traction as a clean, modern and fast Open Source ERP alternative. ERPNext is our most successful product to date. It has been built over the last five years, with a small team and is now used by a few hundred companies worldwide.

So why rock this boat and introduce a new platform Frappe?

Here are the reasons why this is a bad move:

1. There is already traction for ERPNext, why confuse users?
1. Frappe is geared towards developers, will the normal small business user be turned off?
1. Why distribute the value across two brands?

These are all legitimate questions.

While ERPNext is what our users know, internally we have built a platform that can be extended to a whole range of applications, not only ERP systems. Building this platform is a better solution for both users and developers.

Developers can now build applications on Frappe that can co-exist with or extend ERPNext. These applications can be add-on features, domain specific customizations or entirely new applications that could re-use a lot of the work we have done with ERPNext. New applications can be built on the standard deployment platform that was created for ERPNext that can increase speed at which new applications can be made.

For users, there are great benefits too.

1. Users can how customize ERPNext at all levels without having to worry messing with the internals.
1. Domain specific, pre-built apps will be available that will reduce time to implementation even further and make ERPNext usable across a range of domains and industries.
1. Most users are afraid of the term ERP - it alludes to an industry that is extremely expensive and for large organizations only.

These benefits will take some time before they become obvious, but our direction is clear. Once the platform is stabilized, expect a whole range of applications that will be available on Frappe.

Our goal has always been to build this platform with minimum resources. The only way this can be possible is if we make this platform very easy for developers to enter and build new applications. Good quality solutions have to be tailored for each type of industry and organization and we don't think we will have the resources to build so many applications. But by making this a platform, we invite developers to be a part of this movement and make good applications, that help organizations run better.
