#### 2. I want to sell ERPNext Service to my customers. How can I do that?

Before you sell anything to anyone, you must be completely convinced that it is the right tool for you to promote. After all, it is your reputation at stake. Before you sell any ERPNext service, we recommend that you evaluate ERPNext very minutely yourself and the best way to do it is self-implementation. Start using ERPNext for billing, customer support, CRM, quoting your customers. Even if you do not want to use it in production, use it as a test. Once, and if, you are convinced of the application, you should demo it to your customers. Nothing sells better than confidence, so its best to be confident before yo sell.

> Disclosure: We use ERPNext extensively in our own organization too!

#### 3. Will I get support during self-implementation?

You do not need to pay for self implmenetation, you can either use the 30-day trial at [FrappeCloud.com](https://frappecloud.com) or use the [Virtual Machine](https://erpnext.com/download). If you need support, you can first go through [the ERPNext user guide](https://erpnext.com/user-guide) and then ask [questions at the forum](/getting-help). If you need priority one-on-one help sessions, you can also buy a subscription service for it.

#### 4. What skills do I require to implement ERPNext?

To implement ERPNext, you must have a general understanding of financial accouting, inventory managment and how organizations manage their information. Skills in spreadsheet tools like Excel will be handy for data import. If you are good in HTML / CSS, you can also create a website from within ERPNext.

#### 5. Do I need to pay anything to start selling ERPNext

No! This is an open source application and it does not require you to pay us anything. You can charge the customer whatever you like for implementation, training, customization and support. You can either host the customer yourself or host it at [FrappeCloud.com](https://frappecloud.com). There is a one time 30% commission on each customer you sign-up at [FrappeCloud.com](https://frappecloud.com) after your first one.

If your customer wants production support on their servers, you can do it yourself, or let us do it by helping the customer by commercial support.

#### 6. What is the general sales / implementation process for ERPNext

1. Ideally, you must first introduce the product and give a quick demo. It is best to highlight that the product is in use in over 300 organizations across 60+ countries and is also affordable and Open Source.
2. If the customer is convinced, you can do a pilot order in a new trial or Virtual Machine so that the customer is able to see her own data in the system.
3. If the customer is willing to go ahead for implementation, you must identify a project champion within the organization.
4. With the project champion, you can start migrating the master data (Items, Customer, Supplier) from the existing system into ERPNext.
5. Before going live, it is best to do a few test orders through the system and check if there is any customization that is needed for the customer's process.
6. Finally before going live, accounting and inventory opening data should be setup and with the help of the champion.
7. If the customer requires the website to be from ERPNext, you will need to help the customer to create content and setup their master data.

#### 8. I want to sell services but pass on development support to you. Does that work?

No, we (Web Notes Technologies) do not do any paid development. All our energy is used in supporting and enhancing the ERPNext product. If you want to develop a feature or customization, you can engage a freelancer or drop in a request on the [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/erpnext-developer-forum). If you are planning do this on any scale, it is best to get one of your developers trained on ERPNext.
