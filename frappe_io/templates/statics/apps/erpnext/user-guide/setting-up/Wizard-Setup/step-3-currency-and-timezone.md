### Default Currency

A currency is a system of money in general use in a particular country. A currency in which revenue is reported for the most accounting transactions by the company is called the default currency.

For example: In US, the currency would be denoted as USD. In India it would be INR. If you have customers in both these countries and you deal in both the currencies, you will still have to mention any one of them as your default currency. For individual transactions you can change the default currency to any the transaction specific one.

Click on the drop-down menu and select your default currency.

### Time Zone

A time zone is a geographic region within which the same standard time is used. It is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time, so time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions.

For Example, If you are in Muscat you will select Asia/Muscat and if you are in Manila, you will select Asia/Manila.

Click on the dropdown menu and select your options from the given list.
